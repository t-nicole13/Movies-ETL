# Movies-ETL

Amazing Prime Video is an online platform for streaming movies and tv shows. 

## Objective

### Goal:  Build an algorithm to figure out which low budget films will become popular in order to buy streaming rights of these movies at a bargain.

### Analysis  1: Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Method
    - Task 1: Extract data from wikipedia-movies.json (movie list from 1990 - 2018), movies_metadata.csv, and ratings.csv files.
    - Task 2: Transform datasets by using Python and Pandas to clean and join them together. 
    - Task 3: Load cleaned dataset into a PostgreSQL table.
    
### Analysis 2: Refactor Code From Analysis 1
    - Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
    - Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
    - Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
    - Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database
    
## Resources
- Files: wikipedia-movies.json, movies_metadata.csv (from kaggle.com), ratings.csv (from kaggle.com)
- Software/Dependencies: json 2.0.9, pandas 1.3.5, numpy 1.20.3, jupyter notebook 6.4.6, python 3.7, regex 2.2.1
